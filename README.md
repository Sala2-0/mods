# Alternative names
This mod replaces many ship names with alternative names based on how i feel they should be called.
### OBS
- Some names may be offensive to some people, use this mod with caution
- This mod was originally a personal mod between me and my friends so some names will have context behind them and might not make sense to you
- Since game texts get added, removed or modified with every update, you need to install the latest version for every update

## Installation
1. Download the latest "texts.zip" file
2. Extract the zip file
3. Move the entire extracted folder to your res_mods folder, usually its in C:/Games/World_of_Warships/bin/<largest_number>

And you are good to go!
